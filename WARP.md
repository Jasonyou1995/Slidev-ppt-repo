This repository is purely used for creating slides with the Sli.Dev (or slidev) markdown files; use context7 MCP for syntax reference.

Please make sure that the audience for the slides are financial master students, so they are in business school and have very little technical background or understanding of the theories. The goal for this slice is to educate them so that they can always grasp both the basic and the syntax foundation and the mathematics behind data science, machine learning, web creating, API processing, and Python programming language.

The structure of the slidev markdown file should have each slide to be easily understandable and fashionable. Speaking time should be within 3 to 8 minutes and make sure that the slides are fancy and clean, which means every single page should only contain minimal contents. You can have many pages, but every single page should have notes for the speaker, but hidden from the audience, and every single page should have clear progress of animation, so that the audience can easily see each part in a very detailed manner, that means you should focus on the basics first and highlight and take notes on the parts that are important for the theory and stuff before you dive into the code so that students can have multiple steps of processing and think step-by-step. Most ideal explanation is half 60 to 80% of the content that contain only a single line of code in each page and the code is selected so they are very important and make sure that the information conveyed are useful for students and when you create a size the size are highlighted in the right progress.

PS: the logo and irrelavent info like brands are to be ignored. Some code are converted from notebooks, so deal with that. Also, you need to give each one slide created a clear name.
