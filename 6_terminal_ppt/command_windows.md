## üß≠ Part 1: Preliminaries
### What is the Command Prompt?

- The **Command Prompt** (or terminal) is a **text-based interface** for communicating with your computer.  
- It allows developers to:
  - Navigate the file system  
  - Run scripts or programs  
  - Manage files quickly and efficiently  

> Developers love it because it‚Äôs faster and more powerful than using menus or buttons.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Opening PowerShell

To open a PowerShell prompt:

1. Press **Windows + S** to open **Search**  
2. Type **PowerShell**  
3. Press **Enter**

Alternatively, right-click the **Start Menu** ‚Üí select **Windows PowerShell**

> PowerShell is a modern replacement for the old `cmd.exe`.

---

### üìÇ Files and Directory Structure

- Windows organizes data into **directories** (folders).  
- The top-level drive is `C:\`  
- Your personal files live in:  
  `C:\Users\your-username`

The **home directory** can be represented as `~` (similar to Linux).

```powershell {monaco}
pwd
```

Prints the current directory path.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Part 2: Common Commands in PowerShell

### üìÑ Listing Files in a Directory

```powershell {monaco}
ls
```

Lists all files in the current folder.

For detailed information (including hidden files):

```powershell {monaco}
ls -Force
```

---

### üö∂ Moving Between Directories

```powershell {monaco}
cd directory-name
```

Change to another folder.

```powershell {monaco}
cd ..
```

Move up one level.

```powershell {monaco}
cd ~
```

Return to your home directory.

---

### üè† Your Home and Projects Directory

It's common for developers to keep work in:

```powershell {monaco}
cd ~/projects
```

If it doesn't exist, create it:

```powershell {monaco}
mkdir projects
```

Organizing code in projects keeps things neat.

---

### üì¶ Moving and Copying Files

Move a file:

```powershell {monaco}
mv file.txt ~/projects
```

Copy a file:

```powershell {monaco}
cp file.txt ~/projects
```

Rename a file:

```powershell {monaco}
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

---

### üóëÔ∏è Deleting Files and Directories

Delete a file:

```powershell {monaco}
rm file.txt
```

Delete an empty folder:

```powershell {monaco}
rmdir folder
```

Delete a folder and all its contents:

```powershell {monaco}
rm -r folder
```

Always double-check paths before removing recursively!

---

## üëÅÔ∏è Part 3: Hidden Files

### What Are Hidden Files?

- Files starting with `.` are hidden.
- Common examples: `.gitignore`, `.env`

List them:

```powershell {monaco}
ls -Force
```

---

### üìù Creating and Editing a .env File

Create a hidden file:

```powershell {monaco}
ni .env
```

Edit with Notepad:

```powershell {monaco}
notepad .env
```

View contents:

```powershell {monaco}
cat .env
```

`.env` files often store secret keys and environment settings.

---

## ü™ü Part 4: PowerShell vs. Anaconda Prompt

### Understanding the Difference

- **PowerShell:**  
  The general-purpose Windows shell: versatile for all system operations.
- **Anaconda Prompt:**  
  A specialized environment provided by Anaconda for managing Python environments and packages.

Essentially, Anaconda Prompt = PowerShell + Python setup preloaded.

You can use either, but Anaconda makes working with Python smoother.
